								There’s no better way to hone your skills than putting your images to the test in a photo competition evaluated by trained jurors who evaluate images against a set of 12 elements. The jurors review your image and provide you with constructive feedback, so you know just where and how to improve!<br><br>
								<b>IPC’s Photographic Open Competition Rules</b>
								The purpose of this competition is to allow photographers to enter photographic prints, digital files, and/or digital albums to be judged against a standard of excellence using the 12 Elements of a Merit Image. (For more information, go to PPA.com/IPC.) Through this competition, PPA members are also eligible to achieve PPA exhibition merits toward the Master of Photography degree.<br>

								Within one week after the judging, entrants will be notified via the PPA website of their achievement. Press releases will also be available as soon as possible for download from the PPA website for General and/or Loan Collection entries.<br>

								These rules pertain to images entered as prints or digital files created by any photographic processes. All entries must be registered at PPA.com.<br>

								<li>Entrants may submit a case of either print, digital files, digital albums, or a combination for judging at PPA.com. (Maximum of 4 entries.</li>
								<li>Entrants are required to upload a digital file for each image (print or file) entered. NOTE: For physical print entries, the digital file submitted MUST match both the image and presentation. If, for example, the submitted print has a mat, and the digital file does not show the mat, the entry will be eligible for merit and loan and will be displayed as such in the IPC print display at Imaging USA, but will not appear in the Loan or Showcase Collection books, nor on the PPA website.</li>
								<li>No changes to your entry are permitted once the entry deadline has passed. No refunds will be issued after the entry fee is paid.</li>
								<li>Entrants must be PPA members to compete in the Photographic Open Competition.</li><br>

								<li>The entrant’s name shall not appear anywhere in or on the face of the entry.</li>
								<li>A maximum of four entries may be submitted per entrant.</li>
								<li>No entry will be eligible if it has been made under the supervision of an instructor or as a class assignment. All images submitted must be self-directed. Images created in an educational environment under direct supervision from an instructor are ineligible.</li>
								<li>Any entry that has been created from an existing photograph, portrait, graphic, or any other artwork produced by another person is a violation of the competition rules and will not be judged, accepted, or displayed. If an entry, in the good-faith opinion of the IPCC, violates copyright, trademark, or any other applicable law, that entry shall not be displayed or published.</li>
								<li>Entries of the same subject in multiple images will be allowed, as long as the images are entirely different concepts. </li>
								<li>Entries bearing the PPA Affiliated Exhibition Seal of Approval and submitted according to the rules of entry will be automatically accepted for exhibition only when submitted to the next PPA International Photographic Competition immediately following the District competition where awarded. (Entries submitted from within the maker’s assigned District are eligible for Seals of Approval and will be validated at registration.)</li>
								<li>Once an image has been awarded an exhibition merit in any category of PPA competition, it may not be entered again in any other category, at any time, by any entrant. No image that receives a merit may be entered more than once under any condition, including any image from a merited album.</li>
								<li>Images not of acceptable PPA exhibition content will be judged for Merit and Loan but may not be displayed. The decision of acceptable content will be based on the standards set by the National Gallery in Washington, DC and at the discretion of the IPCC.</li><br>
